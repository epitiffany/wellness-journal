    <h1>Tiff's Wellness Journal</h1>
    
    <p> Monday, October 19:  </p>
    <p> Tuesday, October 20: I was able to get out the house and go to the doctor's.</p>
    <p> Wedneday, October 21: I took time out of my day to read after a more than half year hiatus.
        And for therapy because it's the few times I actually talk about my feelings or thoughts.</p>
